UK Supported Software by Joe Connor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
About the scheme
----------------
The Supported Shareware scheme was set up by Joe Connor to encourage 
authors of German/French etc software to produce and support English 
language versions of their software AND to encourage UK users to register 
their software.

Benefits for registered users:
- Key to access registered user only features or remove the Shareware 
  Intro screen (some software only)
- Access to the free update service
- Labelled Master disk
- ST-Guide illustrated on-line catalogue of supported software
- ST-Guide on-line help (some software only)
- Selection of other software (dependent on disk space)

The Shareware fees are set to cover the currency handling, stationary, 
media and postage costs incurred in mailing out master disks. Support for 
users in other countries is available, details on request, please feel free 
to ask or get involved with translation or support in other countries if 
you are able.

The currently supported software is:

How to register inside the UK
-----------------------------
1)  Check the amount for the software you wish to register
2)  Make a cheque payable to Joe Connor for the required amount
3)  Be sure to include your name and address in a legible format!
4)  Send cheque to UK Address below

65 Mill Road, Colchester, CO4 5LJ, England

Email: jconnor@cix.compulink.co.uk

From outside the UK
-------------------
Add ú1 to your order total to cover postage and be sure to make your 
cheque payable in Sterling, Eurocheques and International Post Office Giro 
cheques are fine BUT I can't do anything with cheques made out in 
currencies other than Sterling!

Where can I get updates from?
-----------------------------
The latest versions are listed every month in the Shareware column of ST 
Applications. To receive an update send a self addressed envelope 
including return postage and an unlabelled unformatted double sided floppy 
disk. Please state clearly:

1) The software you'd like updated
2) The version you're currently using
   
If you have Internet access
---------------------------
You can obtain the latest English language releases via anonymous ftp, 
www, gopher, telnet or batch ftp from:

micros.hensa.ac.uk    in the path: micros/atari/tos/...

WWW URL - http://micros.hensa.ac.uk/

The Atari area on hensa is maintained by Denesh Bhabuta who also offers 
support for some other Atari packages and produces a newsletter containing 
details of the latest files on hensa. To be added to the mailing list or 
if you have any other queries concerning hensa Email Denesh: 

danny@micros.hensa.ac.uk

Other sites are allowed to carry the on-line archives but because minor 
updates to the English language version are sometimes made without 
changing the version number hensa is the place to go!
